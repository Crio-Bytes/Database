### What to expect from this micro-byte?

This is a beginner-friendly micro-byte focused to give readers an idea about what SQL is and how it is used in Database Management System.
We'll go through the introduction first and then, we'll step by step create a databse and manipulate records in it.

### Prerequisites

No such prerequisites are needed to get started with SQL.
Just an introduction and you are good to go.

## What is SQL ?

SQL stands for **Structured Query Language.** 
It is an ANSI standard language which is used to interact with databases.

### Why it is used ?

SQL is used to manipulate data in databases. One can use it to :

+ retrieve data from a database

+ insert records in a database

+ update records in a database

+ create and delete databases

+ create and drop tables in the database


<h3> What is a Database ? </h3>

A database is a **collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated.** 
In layman language, we can say that it is an organized collection of data.

### Database Management System

It allows the user to **interact with database.** It is a system software responsible for creation, updation and complete management of database.

## Getting Started with SQL

### Step 1 : Choose a SQL Editor to start with

You'll need a SQL editor where you can run your SQL commands. 

There are various such editors to choose from such as :
 
 + Oracle SQL Developer
 
 + MySQL Workbench
 
 + Squirrel SQL 
  and many others.

You can choose any of these editors according to your convenience.

If you don't wish to download any of them, there are also a lot of online editors out there which you can try.

### Step 2 : Open the Editor

Open the editor to get started with SQL. I'm using an online Editor to demonstrate the working of queries.

### Step 3 : Create a Database to work on

The first thing that you'll need to manipulate a database, is the database itself. Here, you can store information and can make changes in it later on.

We'll start by creating a Database by using a query. 

CREATE DATABASE DATABASE_NAME;

### Step 4 : Use the Database and Insert a table to store entries

Use the database and create a table for storing entries in it.
Specify the columns and type of data that would be stored in it.

### Step 5 : Add entries to the table

Add entries to the table according to your preferences. You can modify the contents and update it as per your wish.
